Dear candidate,

Before the next round of discussion with you, we would like you to perform the following exercise.
We will use this project as a discussion point in the next round of interview with you.
Please zip and send your project (code,assumptions) before the next round of discussion.
Make assumptions where you feel the requirements are not clear or you cannot implement because of time constraints.
The focus is on readability, error handling, ansible best practices, playbook being idempotent etc.
Be prepared to walk through, demo and discuss your approach.

Please write a simple ansible playbook.
Should be able to run this on a centos/debian target host. You can write the playbook targeted towards a single OS of your choice

-install mysql
-create mysql database
-create mysql user with access to the database
-create table comcastinterview with the following columns
-Name, date
-insert a single record with your name and date.

-copy the following script on the target host
-run a cron job every 2 hour using this script.

Database check script
======================
-Also write a simple bash/python script which checks the size of the database, status of the mysql service and alerts through email if it crosses 150 GB or the mysql service is not running.

Please encapsulate your task in a new ansible galaxy role for reuse by the rest of the organization. Use variables, defaults as appropriate.
